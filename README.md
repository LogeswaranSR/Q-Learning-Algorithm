Implementation of Q-Learning Algorithm in Frozen Lake Environment
This is a sample project developed during my Reinforcement Learning Tutorial. It is a simulation of the Q-Learning Algorithm, a Reinforcement Learning Algorithm, in the Frozen Lake Environment. The algorithm is trained with the help of [OpenAI Gym](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/) Library.
